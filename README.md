# sumAndDifference

The C program asks for a and b as inputs.

Then, updates a and b in the following manner:-

a = a + b  (sum of the entered numbers)
b = |a - b| (absolute value of the difference between the entered numbers)

And these changes occur in the variables, using the concept of pointers.
